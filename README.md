## What is the Alexander Technique

"Much higher level of functioning"

"Much less than usual"

One of the perks or main talking points is the fact that one can actually learn how to bring oneself back towards this specific state of mind, or homeostatic stationary state of equilibrium for the bodymind.

### A Short Biopic on FMA

Sidney, London, horses, Shakespeare. His brother's accident and recovery. His own demateration.

#### On the matter of his brother

There was an infamous junction in which a grave injury was inflicted upon FMA's brother, GA (?). As he recovered throughout the next few months, all he could do was what I now have learned to call "Inhibition". One might even come to believe that this is entirely what matters about the Alexander Technique.

## On the matter of Inhibition

The concept as conceived by Freud, in his own context and work territory. The concept as described/discovered by FMA.

### What is a session with an Alexander teacher?

I am quite unclear on how to actually present the Alexander Technique to a person. As a matter of fact, I have come to be quite convinced that the actuality of what a session is will eventually come to be seen as one of the most fundamental cornerstones of human relations and relationships.

An example:

As one might guess, the explanation of what has just perspired in that time certainly cannot fit anywhere but in a discourse by a clown.

#### How do I find an Alexander teacher?

There are websites, yes. It has become much easier nowadays. However, I do not live in one of the largest centers, and therefore have had to look a little harder.
